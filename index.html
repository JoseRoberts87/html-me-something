<h1>Where I Began</h1>
<p>My first true exposure to programing was in my current job.<br>
I was made aware one day of a Microsoft Access Database<br>
that was used too automate a process that would otherwise<br>
take three days and three human resources.</p>
<br>
<p>After reviewing the database and figuring out how the<br>
databse worked, as well as understanding how to update and<br>
reconfiguring it with the new data, my interest for automation<br>
peaked. It was at this moment that I decided to pursue the<br>
path of a developer.</p>

<h1>Where I am Now</h1>

in Computer Science, with a concentration in Soft Engineering.<br>
My goal is to become a developer and revolutionize the world!</p>
